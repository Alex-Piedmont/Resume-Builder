## [Employer Name — e.g., "Acme Corp"]

# Copy this entire section for each employer. Fill in all fields.
# The more context you provide, the better the resume output will be.

Who is [Employer]?
    [1-2 sentences describing what the company does, its size, and industry.
    This helps Claude frame your experience for readers who may not recognize
    the company name.]

Timeframe:
    [Start Year] - [End Year or "Present"]

Relevant Titles:
    [List all titles you held OR titles that could credibly describe your role.
    Claude will select the best match for each job application.]
    # Use any of these titles as appropriate based on the application requirements

Key Wins:
    # These are your headline accomplishments — the 2-4 things you'd mention
    # in a 30-second elevator pitch about this role. Include hard numbers.
    - [Win 1 — e.g., "Grew revenue 40% YoY across a $15M portfolio"]
    - [Win 2 — e.g., "Launched product from 0→1 in 6 months, $2M first-year revenue"]
    - [Win 3 — e.g., "Reduced operational costs by $1.2M through process automation"]

Relevant Experience:
    # Detailed bullets about what you did. Include metrics, tools, team sizes,
    # client names (if not confidential), and business context. More detail
    # here means better resume bullets later.
    #
    # Don't worry about polish — write in whatever form is natural.
    # Claude will rewrite these as impact-first statements.
    - [Experience bullet 1]
    - [Experience bullet 2]
        - [Sub-detail if helpful — e.g., specific tools, methodologies, results]
    - [Experience bullet 3]
    - [Experience bullet 4]

Leadership Style:
    # How you operated day-to-day. Who did you interact with?
    # What level of stakeholders? How large was your team?
    - [e.g., "Managed a team of 8 analysts and 3 contractors"]
    - [e.g., "Reported to VP of Strategy; presented quarterly to C-Suite"]
    - [e.g., "Cross-functional collaboration with Engineering, Sales, and Finance"]

Notable Clients:
    # Optional. Include if client names add credibility (Fortune 500, etc.)
    [e.g., Google, Johnson & Johnson, Shell]

## [Next Employer — copy the section above]

# Repeat the employer section for each role in your career history.
# Go in reverse chronological order (most recent first).
# For older roles (10+ years ago), you can abbreviate — Key Wins and
# a few Relevant Experience bullets are usually sufficient.

---

# section of the resume. Claude will select the most relevant ones
# for each application.
